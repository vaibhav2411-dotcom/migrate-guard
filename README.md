## ✨ What is Migrate Guard?

**Migrate Guard** is an all-in-one automated website migration testing toolkit. It lets engineering/product/QA teams run side-by-side production/candidate comparisons and generate human-friendly reports for Go/No-Go launches and retro analysis.

- **Visual regressions:** Detect pixel diffs, layout shifts, and subtle UI changes
- **Functional QA:** Broken link detection, navigation & forms, JS errors, HAR analysis
- **Data validation:** Compare DOM/text, tables, JSON APIs, and key field mappings
- **AI-powered executive risk analysis:** Severity, risk scores, recommendations (Azure OpenAI!)
- **Super-powered dev workflow:** Snapshots, artifact management, and integrated REST API

### 💰 Cost Breakdown

| Component | Cost | Notes |
|-----------|------|-------|
| File-based storage (current) | $0/mo | JSON snapshots, no DB needed |
| Azure OpenAI API | $1–10/mo | Usage-based; 100 runs = ~$5/mo |
| Optional: Cloud DB (PostgreSQL) | $15–50/mo | Only if scaling >1000 runs/mo |
| Optional: Blob storage (images) | $5–20/mo | Only if cloud-hosting artifacts |
| **Total (lean start)** | **$0–1/mo** | File storage + minimal AI |
| **Total (standard)** | **$50–70/mo** | All features, growth-ready |

- Extend the API in `backend/src/routes/api.ts` using strong schema validation
- Follow conventions in `DEVELOPERS.md` for testability, feature flags, and separation of concerns

## 📦 Artifacts & Outputs

- All run outputs (screenshots, HAR, logs, reports) are stored under `backend/data/artifacts/{runId}`
- Artifacts are organized per run and available for download via the API

## 🧩 Feature Flags & Test Matrix

**Migrate Guard** is structured as a strict TypeScript monorepo with clear backend/frontend separation:

- **Backend (Node.js, Fastify, TypeScript):**
  - Modular "agents" in `backend/src/services/` for crawling, QA, visual diff, data validation, and AI-powered reporting.
  - RESTful API in `backend/src/routes/api.ts` exposes all core operations.
  - Strongly typed models in `backend/src/models.ts`.
  - All persistent data and artifacts (screenshots, HAR, logs, reports) are stored under `backend/data/artifacts/{runId}`.
  - Configurable via files in `backend/src/config/`.
  - Feature flags and test matrices enable/disable AI, diff, QA, etc.

- **Frontend (React 18, Vite, TypeScript):**
  - UI components in `src/components/`, page views in `src/pages/`, and shared types in `src/lib/types.ts`.
  - State management and API logic in `src/lib/store.ts` and `src/lib/api.ts`.
  - Connects to backend API for job/runs management, artifact viewing, and reporting.

- **Extensibility:**
  - Add new agents/services in `backend/src/services/` and extend models in `backend/src/models/`.
  - API endpoints are added in `backend/src/routes/api.ts` with strong schema validation.
  - All config is JSON or TypeScript—no hardcoded values.

- **Data Flow:**
  - Jobs and runs are created via the API, triggering agents to process sites and generate artifacts.
  - Artifacts are stored per run and accessed via the API and frontend dashboard.

- **AI Integration:**
  - `AiReasoningService` uses Azure OpenAI for risk analysis and recommendations.
  - AI features are controlled via feature flags and test matrices.
