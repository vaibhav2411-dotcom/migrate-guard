## ✨ What is Migrate Guard?

**Migrate Guard** is an all-in-one automated website migration testing toolkit. It lets engineering/product/QA teams run side-by-side production/candidate comparisons and generate human-friendly reports for Go/No-Go launches and retro analysis.

- **Visual regressions:** Detect pixel diffs, layout shifts, and subtle UI changes
- **Functional QA:** Broken link detection, navigation & forms, JS errors, HAR analysis
- **Data validation:** Compare DOM/text, tables, JSON APIs, and key field mappings
- **AI-powered executive risk analysis:** Severity, risk scores, recommendations (Azure OpenAI!)
- **Super-powered dev workflow:** Snapshots, artifact management, and integrated REST API

See [backend/README.md](./backend/README.md) for full setup & CLI options.


## 🧩 Architecture Highlights

### Agents & Services
- **CrawlAgent**: Dual-site crawler, sitemap support, page matcher
- **PlaywrightExecutionService**: Browser/DOM/screenshot/console collector
- **VisualDiffService**: Pixel, layout, and heatmap insight
- **FunctionalQaAgent**: Navigation, forms, links, JS errors, HAR capture

**Migrate Guard** – Secure your migrations, delight your users, and sleep better at night. 🚀🛡️

## 🧪 Testing

- **Backend tests:**
  - Run all backend tests: `cd backend && npm test` (see `backend/tests/` for entry points)
- **Frontend tests:**
  - Add or run tests in `src/pages/` as needed (see project conventions)

## 🧹 Linting & Formatting

- Lint all code: `npm run lint` (uses flat config)
- TypeScript strict mode is enforced throughout the project.

## 🛠️ Extending & Contributing

- Add new agents/services in `backend/src/services/` and models in `backend/src/models/`
- Extend the API in `backend/src/routes/api.ts` using strong schema validation
- Follow conventions in `DEVELOPERS.md` for testability, feature flags, and separation of concerns

## 📦 Artifacts & Outputs

- All run outputs (screenshots, HAR, logs, reports) are stored under `backend/data/artifacts/{runId}`
- Artifacts are organized per run and available for download via the API

## 🧩 Feature Flags & Test Matrix

- Feature flags and test matrices are used to enable/disable AI, diff, QA, and other features
- Configure these in the relevant config or test files as described in `DEVELOPERS.md`

**Migrate Guard** is structured as a strict TypeScript monorepo with clear backend/frontend separation:

- **Backend (Node.js, Fastify, TypeScript):**
  - Modular "agents" in `backend/src/services/` for crawling, QA, visual diff, data validation, and AI-powered reporting.
  - RESTful API in `backend/src/routes/api.ts` exposes all core operations.
  - Strongly typed models in `backend/src/models.ts`.
  - All persistent data and artifacts (screenshots, HAR, logs, reports) are stored under `backend/data/artifacts/{runId}`.
  - Configurable via files in `backend/src/config/`.
  - Feature flags and test matrices enable/disable AI, diff, QA, etc.

- **Frontend (React 18, Vite, TypeScript):**
  - UI components in `src/components/`, page views in `src/pages/`, and shared types in `src/lib/types.ts`.
  - State management and API logic in `src/lib/store.ts` and `src/lib/api.ts`.
  - Connects to backend API for job/runs management, artifact viewing, and reporting.

- **Extensibility:**
  - Add new agents/services in `backend/src/services/` and extend models in `backend/src/models/`.
  - API endpoints are added in `backend/src/routes/api.ts` with strong schema validation.
  - All config is JSON or TypeScript—no hardcoded values.

- **Data Flow:**
  - Jobs and runs are created via the API, triggering agents to process sites and generate artifacts.
  - Artifacts are stored per run and accessed via the API and frontend dashboard.

- **AI Integration:**
  - `AiReasoningService` uses Azure OpenAI for risk analysis and recommendations.
  - AI features are controlled via feature flags and test matrices.
